Statistical Models:
Statistical models are mathematical representations used to describe and analyze data and make predictions or inferences based on that data. These models capture the 
underlying statistical relationships and patterns within the data, allowing us to gain insights, understand the data-generating process, and make informed decisions.

Statistical models can take various forms, including regression models, time series models, classification models, and more. Let's explain with an example of a linear 
regression model:

Example: Linear Regression Model
Suppose we have a dataset that contains information about houses, including the size of the house in square feet and the corresponding price in dollars. 
We want to build a statistical model that can predict the price of a house based on its size.

A linear regression model can be used in this case. It assumes a linear relationship between the input variable (size of the house) and the output variable (price).
The model's goal is to find the best-fitting line that represents this relationship.

The linear regression model can be defined as:
Price = β0 + β1 * Size + ε

Price represents the predicted price of the house.
Size represents the size of the house.
β0 and β1 are the coefficients or parameters of the model that need to be estimated. They determine the intercept and slope of the linear relationship between the size and 
price. ε is the error term or residual, representing the part of the price that cannot be explained by the model.
To estimate the coefficients β0 and β1, we use a process called "ordinary least squares" (OLS). This process minimizes the sum of squared differences between the 
actual prices and the predicted prices generated by the model.

Once the model is trained and the coefficients are estimated, we can use it to make predictions on new, unseen data. For example, given the size of a new house, 
the model can predict its price based on the learned relationship.

Statistical models like linear regression provide a quantitative framework for analyzing data, understanding relationships, and making predictions or inferences. 
They are valuable tools in many fields, including economics, finance, social sciences, and machine learning.
